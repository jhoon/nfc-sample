## NFC Sample

Demo app to demonstrate the use of NFC / Android Beam.

[Available in the Google Play Store][1]

## What does it do?

Uses Android Beam™ to send a "Hello NFC" Message to another smartphone inside 
the app, which will show such message in a SnackBar. If the app is not installed,
it will simply open the Play Store and search for the app. 

In case putting together two phones on the back for a long time is not
your cup of tea, you can also press a button and launch the app in Beam™
mode, so it can complete the transfer as soon as it detects another
NFC device, instead of having to press the screen after putting them
back to back.
